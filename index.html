		<div>NEXT</div>
		<div>Repeat</div>
		<div>Little Green Chicken was worried. He started getting worried when he read that some day the sky might fall down. The article he read was very scientific, seemed reasonable and very scary. According to the article, barnyard behavior was causing a buildup of pollutants in the sky. If this continued the sky would become weighted down with pollutants and eventually collapse.
</div>
		<div>Back</div>
		<div>
</div>
		<div>Listen</div>
		<div>Little Green Chicken became worried and began to read everything he could about the growth of barnyard pollution and sky degradation, as it was called. He learned that quite a few things barnyard animals did created pollution, which over the years was slowly building up in the sky. When the cows farted, the pigs ate and wallowed, the goats and sheep ate the grass and everything else from their pastures, and the farmer cut down more trees to make fields to feed the animals; it all caused pollution
</div>
		<div>The Little Green Chicken became convinced that unless the barnyard changed it’s ways the sky would become so heavy that it would fall and destroy the barnyard. So he began a campaign to get the barnyard animals to reduce their pollution in hopes of staving off what he perceived as impending disaster.  Alas, none of the other animals believed him and were certainly not about to change their comfortable lifestyles because of the crazed rantings of a little green chicken.  So things continued much as before.</div>
		<div>One morning, as the depressed  Little Green Chicken was moping around the barnyard, his sorrowful eyes cast downward.   He noticed a blue fleck lying on the ground.  He pecked it up and examined it.  It was beautiful, soft and blue, but much too heavy for such a small fleck.</div>
		<div>Could this be part of the sky?  He quickly returned to the books and discovered that this is exactly what the scientist predicted the sky would look like if it began to fall.  Alarmed he ran to the other animals showing them the blue fleck and explaining what he thought it was and what it meant. They simply yawned and went on about their business. “You know Little Chicken, there was once another little chicken that tried to warn us about the sky falling and it didn’t happen then and won’t happen now.  So leave us alone.”</div>
		<div>The next morning Little Green Chicken discovered the whole barn yard covered with little flecks to the point it was even hard to walk. “See,” he clucked, “now do you believe that the sky is falling?”
But his warning was met with:“No it isn’t, that is just heavy dew.”“The barnyard will survive.  It always has.  Anyway, it’s kind of nice.”“Even if it is falling its too late now.  We might as well enjoy  ourselves while we can.
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>All through the day the sky showered down on the barnyard and its animals who went right along as though nothing was happening. Gradually the shower of blue turned  to a blizzard of blue.  When the animals went to bed the pretty blue flacks had turned to big heavy chunks that killed several of the animals who had been unable to squeeze into  the safety of the barn.</div>
		<div>The next morning the farmer came out to find the barnyard and all the animals were gone, buried under a massive pile of blue. He simply shook his head. “Oh well,” he said to himself, “ I guess the chicken got it right this time.  Too bad nobody listened.” And he set off to start a new farm.                                                       The End</div>
